There are four primary building blocks: device, format, action, and devicetree.
Each block device is represented by an instance of StorageDevice. The format of
the data on that device is represented by an instance of DeviceFormat. Any
change to a device or format is represented by an instance of DeviceAction. The
collection of devices is represented by an instance of DeviceTree. To schedule a
change to a device (create, destroy, resize) or its formatting (create, resize,
destroy) you instantiate an instance of the appropriate class and then register
that action with the devicetree. Once this is done, the tree will appear as if
the action had already been performed. That means devices scheduled for creation
are visible in the tree and devices scheduled for destruction are no longer in
the tree once the action has been registered. This can go on until you have the
full configuration you want, at which point you tell blivet to process the
action queue. This is where the changes are actually written to disk.
