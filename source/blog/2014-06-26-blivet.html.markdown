In this first post I want to give a quick introduction to Blivet.

Blivet is a python module for configuring storage on Linux. It is also the
storage backend for Anaconda -- the Fedora OS installer. That's where
Blivet came from, so anything you've done with storage while installing
Fedora (since Fedora 11) is something Blivet can do.

It can create and manage LVM, MD, LUKS, BTRFS, and a whole slew of other
storage technologies.

It can model a series of operations so you can tweak your layout before
changing anything on disk.

It also includes a set of classes for specifying new devices based on a top-
down specification, so you can go from an empty disk to an encrypted LVM
setup using thin provisioning with a single method call.
